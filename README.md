# Boston Police Index

## System Architecture:

This web-app is a site with a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, with a PostreSQL server as the backend interacted with using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). We also use [Material UI](https://mui.com) and [TSX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) to assist in the front-end.

The [Boston Police Index](https://dev-bpi.netlify.app), aims to be a successor to the now inactive [Woke Windows](https://www.wokewindows.org) project, where we aim to make Boston police data as accessible and easy to understand for as many people as possible.

# Directory Structure Overview

**`/components`** - where all components live that are referenced 1 or more times in `/pages`. These are kept here as they aren't routable and it promotes reusability + organization. Consider creating components to put in this directory instead of writing extremely long files in `/pages` 

**`/interfaces`** - where all reused TypeScript interfaces live for code cleanliness and reusability purposes. Interfaces that are only used in the source file and a little elsewhere live in their source file.

**`/lib`** - where all GraphQL queries live as well as the Apollo Client Initialization 

**`/pages`** - the standard directory in Next.js for routing ([brush up about it here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts)). Every directory is a path, so everything in this directory is routable ([except for those starting with _](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#private-folders)). For components of specific pages that most likely have no other use (ex: `./feedback/_FeedbackForm.tsx`) you can colocate those with their respective page. `./profile` and `./data/tables` make use of [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#private-folders).

**`/public`** - the standard directory in Next.js for images. Keep all src images in this directory. Many of these images are not actually being used, feel free to clean those out.

**`/services`** - where complex data fetching logic can be placed instead of bloating files in the `/pages` directory. Serves same purpose as `/components` but for data fetching.

**`/styles`** - where themes, global styles, and hex code variables are stored. Only need to touch this if changing the color / ratios of the site.

**`/utility`** - where ad hoc helper methods, text formatters, and maps live. 


# Getting Set Up to Contribute
1. Populate your own `.env` file using `.env.example`
2. Familiarize yourself with the repository structure (each high level directory has a `README.md` but below there is a summary of what each directory is for)
3. Consult **Work to Be Done** to see what you can work on
4. Get access to all of the resources in the onboarding document (GraphiQL, Notion Kanban, GitHub Private Repo, Postgres DB through DBeaver, Slack channel, `.env` secrets)

## Testing Local Changes
To test changes locally, run either commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) with your browser to see the result.

# Next.js Configuration Information
1. We're using typed routes for Next.js. This means that when you are navigating using `<Link />` or similar methods you will get type checking and type hints for the routes.
2. We are using `superjson` to handle automatic serialization and deserialization of data between the server and the client. This means that you can use `Date` objects and other complex types in your data and they will be serialized and deserialized automatically. It should be noted that the data you return from `getStaticProps` etc should still be fairly "simple" in nature as there is a cost to serialization and deserialization.

# How to Add New Data
Updating the data for this project is very important and thus very common (at least annually). To accomplish this, previous engineers have gone to great lengths to make this as painless as possible.   

**Please follow these steps to a T when adding new data to the website from PostgreSQL**

‚ùìAsk a previous engineer for help if you have any questions as this is a very important process‚ùì

## Creating a New Table
When you are adding a whole new dataset that isn't already in the website. 
1. Change properties in `/utility/tableDefinitions`
     - change `isFake` to `false`
     - add table query to `tablesFromAnalyzeBoston` or `tablesFromPublicRecordsRequests` arrays
2. Create 1 GraphQL Query in `lib/graphql/queries`
    - `GET_NEXT_PAGE_<query_table_name_here>`
4.  Create response interface in `interfaces/dataResponseInterfaces.ts`
5.  Add case to `handleQuery` and `executeDataPageQuery` in `utility/queryUtils.ts`
6. Add `description` attributes to every column that has a known definition in `utility/createMUIGrid.tsx`
   - if definition is unknown at the moment just add `description: "",`
7. Add key-value pair to dictionary in `queryUtils.ts` for `tableDateColumnMap` for date column

## Updating a Table to a New View
When your backend engineer has created a new view representing the most up to date data
1. In `utility/dataViewAliases.ts` swap out view names as you change them. It will automatically adjust the `queries.ts` file but if the schema changes you will need to manually fix those
2. In `utility/dataViewAliases.ts` add it to the `table_name_to_alias_map` if it isn't already there



# Work to Be Done
This is a high level description of what needs to be done. To get access to the [Kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards#:~:text=A%20kanban%20board%20is%20an,order%20in%20their%20daily%20work.) please consult the onboarding materials in Google Drive. Particularly the Project Description.

## üöÄ New Functionality


### 1. Server-Side Pagination Rollout for `/data`

To achieve a **60√ó performance gain**, we are deprecating client-side pagination. As a result, all core features on the `/data` page need to be re-implemented using server-side logic.

**Progress Checklist:**

- [x] Single Page Pagination  
- [x] Exact Filtering (`=`)  
- [x] Sorting (`ASC` / `DESC`)  
- [x] Select Columns  
- [ ] Fuzzy Filtering (`contains`)  
- [ ] Export Current Columns (active filter only)  
- [ ] Export Entire Table (*already in progress, check in with backend engineer regarding Google Cloud Storage)

#### Advice from Previous Engineer on Fuzzy Filtering
Look into Postgraphile Plugins. They allow fuzzy filtering. You can also use the `ilike ('%' || search || '%')` command, but it is very poorly documented and I have not tried it myself.

<ins>Possible Performance Damage:</ins> https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/filtering/

### 2. UX Enhancements for Server-Side Pagination

Improving user experience alongside functional upgrades.

**Planned Improvements:**

- [ ] Preload next **X** pages to reduce pagination lag  
- [ ] Add "Drill Down" pages for each row (similar to officer profile pages) 

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Known Issues to Solve
### 1. Filtering vs Formatted Data Mismatch

**Problem:**  
Users see *formatted* data in `/data`, but filters operate on the *raw* data. This causes confusion when filtering doesn‚Äôt return expected results.

**Why this happens:**
- We use **text formatters** to make raw data more legible.
- Filters are applied to unformatted (raw) values.

**Considered Solutions:**

| Possible Solution                     | Drawbacks                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Change backend data to be legible    | Not sustainable. Every new dataset would need transformation. Risk of losing important raw details. |
| Abandon all text formatters          | Reduces readability. Raw data may be inconsistently typed (e.g., `"T"`/`"F"` strings vs booleans).  |

---

### 2. Pagination Limits Export and Performance

**Problem:**  
The data page only loads the **currently visible rows** on the frontend.

**Implications:**
- "Export Current Columns" only exports the **current page**.
- Pagination is **slow** due to data fetching on each page switch.

### 3. Miscalculation Between Backend + Frontend Calculations of Officer Total Pay Percentile

**Problem:**  
The profile page header **displays a different percentile than the Individual Officer Pay Histogram for the same value** -- Total Pay in the most current year.

**Causes:**
- The percentile in the header is pulled directly from the Homepage materialized view created by the backend engineer
- The percentile in the histogram is calculated on the fly in the frontend in `/components/profileVisualizations/(histogram)/Histogram.tsx` in `const percentile = useMemo(....`

**Solution:**  
**Make sure these calculate the percentile the same way.* The correct way is `=[(totalNumberOfRecordsBelowValue) / (totalNumberOfRecords)] * 100`
